        RETURN of the Ka! <br>
        Our traditional Ford Ka race makes its third appearance now! <br><br>
        </header>
        The first ever Ka race was at Nordschleife, then Bathurst and now.... Mallory ?
        Believe it or not this niche circuit has some crazy battle opportunities and it's unique layout does require a bit of skill to get right, especially in a car that relies on momentum.
        Server for this event will open around Thursday 15/01 since we think the 6 Hours of Green Hell is more important. STILL, we expect a nice clean and fun race for this special ACSL event that marks a tradition of the league. There are 34 gridspots open but only sign up once you 100% know you can participate. If you sign up and don't attend you risk penalties for other upcoming events (even for seasonal events).

        We will do a Blitz Qualifying of only 5 minutes followed up by a little Sprintdurance of 50 minutes with a rolling start. 1 Pitstop is mandatory and you can do what you want in pits. You don't have to change anything theoretically.

        We will allow people to compete in goofy liveries as they wish, only that they need to be appropriate for media purposes.
